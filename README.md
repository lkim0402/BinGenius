# Project: BinGenius
*This project was made for the EduHacks Hackathon 2023*
Introducing our project: BinGenius, a smart trashcan that leverages an advanced deep learning model trained by the dataset Trashnet and TACO to accurately classify waste into three categories - trash, compost, and recycle.

## Description
BinGenius employs computer vision through a deep learning model to analyze the categories of the images of disposed items. Subsequently, the bin's mechanism adjusts its orientation via a precision-controlled pipe to align with the designated category within the trash bin. Upon reaching the correct position, the lid opens, facilitating the organized disposal of waste into the respective compartments. To illustrate this sophisticated process, we have developed a demo animation that precisely captures each step.

By seamlessly integrating technology into waste management, our project aims to enhance recycling efforts and promote sustainable practices for a cleaner and greener future.
